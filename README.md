# MurmurHash3 32-bit TypeScript Implementation

## Overview

TypeScript implementation of the MurmurHash3 32-bit hash function. MurmurHash3 is a fast and efficient hash function suitable for hash-based lookups and data partitioning. The implementation includes a benchmark function to measure the average execution time of hashing operations.


## Purpose
MurmurHash3_32 is ideal for generating unique hashes quickly, especially in non-cryptographic contexts. Itâ€™s used in the [AniTrek](https://anitrek.com/) app for efficient caching and key generation.

## Advantages
MurmurHash3 is faster than many other hashes because it processes multiple bytes at a time, making it efficient for larger datasets.

## Usage

### MurmurHash3_32 Function
This function computes a 32-bit MurmurHash3 hash of a given string with a specified seed.

#### Parameters
* `key`: The input string to hash.
* `seed`: The seed value for the hash function.

#### Returns
* A 32-bit unsigned integer hash value.

#### Example
```ts
    const hash = murmurhash3_32('bannan pie', 0);
```

Benchmarks
-------------------------

The benchmarked reference system uses an Intel i7-9700K cpu, and runs Ubuntu x64 20.04.
The [open source benchmark program] is compiled with `clang` v10.0 using `-O3` flag.
